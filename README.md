ABOUT ChessMoves:
====================

ChessMoves is a Java project which calculates the possible moves of any chess piece, given a configuration of the chess board (which pieces are where), and given the player whose turn it is to play (black or white).

Input:

It produces the output of each possible move of each possible piece, and gives a count of all the moves as well as all the unique pieces which can move.
